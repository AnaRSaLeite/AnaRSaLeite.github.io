								<h1 style="font-size: 150;">About myself</h1>
								<p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:20px"><span class="image right"><img src="images/photome5.png" alt="" /></span>I graduated from the University of Santiago de Compostela (degree in Psychology)
								with honors, did a Master's Degree on Advanced Studies on Language, Communication, and related Pathologies by the same
								University, and defended my PhD in december of 2021 (summa cum laude), entitled "Representation and processing of grammatical gender: Analysing the gender congruency effect". 
								<p style="text-align:justify">I have worked in different projects mainly collecting behavioural and electroencephalographical data
								in the Cognitive Processes and Behaviour group lab of the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), the Center of Research
								in Psychology of the University of Minho (Portugal), the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour of the
								Radboud University (The Netherlands), the Mind, Brain and Behavior Research Centre of the University of Granada (Spain), and the Goethe Universität Frankfurt (Germany).<p style="text-align:justify; margin-top:-25px"> I have won
								competitive fellowships for my PhD and my PhD research stays from the Spanish Ministry of Education; I have also won competitive fellowships from the Foundation for Science and Technology of the Government of Portugal, 
								the Spanish Society for Experimental Psychology, the German DAAD, the Johanna Quandt Young Academy (JQYA), and the Goethe University Frankfurt. I have also gained a position as a postdoc within a project financed by 
								the European Regional Development Fund and the Andalucian Government (Spain). <p style="text-align:justify; margin-top:-25px">
								My current post-doc position was obtained by winning a competitive fellowship, the Dorothea Schlözer Postdoctoral Program by the University of Göttingen (Germany) with a project exploring the impact of sex-based social stereotypes in grammatical gender processing in German.
							</p><p style="text-align:justify; margin-top:-25px">Recently I won a prestigious Emmy Noether project by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), "GenPath" (The cognitive pathways of gender: A cross-linguistic electrophysiological assessment) obtaining more than EUR 1.500.000 to study the neural markers of gender processing in multiple languages.</p>
								<p style="text-align:justify; margin-top:-25px">My model SL2024 (Sá-Leite & Lago, 2024) for gender processing in language comprehension received an award by the European Society of Cognitive Psychology in December 2024. </p>

					<h2>What is gender, you may ask</h2>
					<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:smaller">It has been described as an unessential and meaningless category with no useful purpose (Ibrahim, 1973; of Ockham, n.d./1980), an unnecessary component of language best to be disposed of (Adelung, 1783), a luxury (Bally, 1935; von der Gabelentz, 1891), a superfluous feature (Fodor, 1959), and even a historical accident, a deformity, a bad habit, the cause for many illnesses, including nightmares, pathological behaviours, erotic and religious delusions, sadism, and savagery (de Courtenay, 1929; Kilarski, 2005, p. 29).</p><p>And that's why I study it.</p>
